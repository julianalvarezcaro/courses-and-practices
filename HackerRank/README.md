# HackerRank solutions!

In this directory, I will upload a series of exercises that I've been finding in HackerRank
Solutions found here are my approach to the problem and how I managed to solve them. Some of them I will be corrected with time as for edge cases, structure, or maybe pure optimization of the code.
A summary of the problem statement will be summarized in each file
